LoginPress || Max number of Logins is basically a feature to the existing plugin LoginPress. This feature mainly has two main sides. This feature allows the plugin to fetch the IP of the user upon login and limit the amount of times one can login; this prevents brute force attacks. The admin can also limit the user from a certain area, the admin may restrict some locations and the user from that specified location cannot login.

== Description ==
LoginPress | Max number of Logins is a significant enhancement to the LoginPress plugin, providing advanced security measures to safeguard WordPress websites against brute force attacks and unauthorized access. This feature operates on two key fronts, revolutionizing the way administrators manage user logins and access permissions.
Firstly, by leveraging IP tracking capabilities, the plugin efficiently monitors and records the IP addresses of users upon login attempts. This data is crucial for implementing login restrictions based on the frequency of login attempts originating from specific IPs. By setting a maximum threshold for login attempts within a specified time frame, administrators effectively thwart brute force attacks, where malicious actors attempt to gain unauthorized access by repeatedly guessing passwords.Furthermore, the geographical restriction feature empowers administrators with granular control over user access based on their location. Administrators can define specific geographical regions from which users are allowed or disallowed to log in. This functionality is invaluable for websites that need to restrict access to sensitive information or comply with regional regulations. For instance, an e-commerce website may want to block login attempts from countries where fraudulent activities are prevalent to mitigate risks associated with online transactions.
In essence, LoginPress | Max number of Logins represents a proactive approach to WordPress security, providing administrators with the tools needed to reinforce access controls and fortify their websites against emerging cyber threats. By combining IP tracking and geographical restrictions, this feature elevates the security posture of WordPress websites, instilling confidence among administrators and users alike in the integrity of their digital environments.
